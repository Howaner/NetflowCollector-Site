I was looking for software to store the Netflow data of my router in a database, so that I could evaluate it later using small scripts. Since I didn't find good software for it, I decided to develop a tool for it myself.  
So far only MongoDB is supported as database and the software is only tested with Mikrotik and EdgeRouter's, but I'm sure there are other people who can use such a software. That's why I made the project publicly available.
